Hello y ¡bienvenidos! I am a second-year PhD student in Hispanic Linguistics at the [University of Florida](https://spanishandportuguese.ufl.edu/graduate-programs/hispanic-linguistics-2/). I am co-advised by [Dr. Jorge Valdés Kroff](https://people.clas.ufl.edu/jvaldeskroff/) and [Dr. Edith Kaan](https://people.clas.ufl.edu/kaan/). I conduct research in the [Bilingual Sentence Processing Lab](https://bsplab.clas.ufl.edu/) and the [Brain, Language, and Bilingualism Lab](https://blab.lin.ufl.edu/).

I use psycho-/neurolinguistic methods like eye-tracking and EEG to investigate the cognitive processes underlying (bilingual) language processing and code-switching. My work also considers how bilingualism might be modulatory of or interact with domain-general abilities, such as conflict adaptation, Theory of Mind, and even working memory in cognitive decline. At its core, my research is concerned with characterizing how the experiential dimensions of bilingualism impact real-time language processing and the cognitive mechanisms underlying it.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
