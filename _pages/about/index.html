I conduct research in the <a href="https://bsplab.clas.ufl.edu/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Bilingual Sentence Processing Lab</a> and the <a href="https://blab.lin.ufl.edu/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Brain, Language, and Bilingualism Lab</a>.</p> <p>I use psycho-/neurolinguistic methods like eye-tracking and EEG to investigate the cognitive processes underlying (bilingual) language processing and code-switching. My work also considers how bilingualism might be modulatory of or interact with domain-general abilities, such as conflict adaptation, attention, Theory of Mind, and even working memory in cognitive decline. At its core, my research is concerned with characterizing how the experiential dimensions of bilingualism and language use impact real-time language processing and cognitive mechanism recruitment.</p> </body></html>
