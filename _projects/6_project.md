Language learning promotes neuroplasticity by engaging neurocognitive mechanisms such as processing speed, working memory, and executive functions. In aging, these mechanisms experience natural decline; however, long-term engagement of neurocognitive mechanisms can result in greater cognitive and neural reserve in aging. Previous research shows that new language training induces rapid brain changes and improves cognitive functions in children and younger adults. Relatively little is known however about the efficacy of novel, short-term language learning as a tool for promoting neurocognitive reserve and resilience for healthy older adults. The present study assesses the outcomes of a new language training intervention in healthy older adults on vocabulary acquisition and working memory.

Older monolingual adults (n = 14; 9 female; mean age 70.2; data collection ongoing) complete a behavioral (i.e. personal social network, category fluency, and narrative elicitation tasks) and EEG (i.e. resting state and n-back task) pre-test session after which they are randomly assigned to a Spanish Language Training (SLT) condition or an Active Control (AC) condition. After completing a daily training regimen for 36 days, participants return for a post-test session. **(Presented at [Psychonomics2024}(https://cdn.ymaws.com/www.psychonomic.org/resource/resmgr/annual_meeting/2024_meeting/abstract_book/2024_abstracts_final.pdf), [FPM2025](https://mll.fsu.edu/event/florida-psycholinguistics-meeting-2025), [NCF SfN](https://neuroscience.ufl.edu/outreach/sfn-north-central-fl-chapter/), and the [2025 Dallas Aging and Cognition Conference](https://dacc.utdallas.edu/program/)**
