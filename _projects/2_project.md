In offline judgment tasks, late Spanish learners of L1 English reliably intuit the acceptability of intrasentential Spanish-English code-switches, i.e., codeswitches between languages within the complementizer phrase. Are these felicitous intuitions mirrored in adult L2
online processing?

# Experiment 1

CS processing is subject to modulation not only by language internal properties, but also by extralinguistic factors, including the distributional patterns of bilingual language production specific to a given bilingual community. To tease apart the roles of grammar and
experience in CS processing, a group of advanced L1 English, L2 Spanish learners (*n*=39) immersed in an environment with ubiquitous code-switching participated in a reading-while-eyetracking experimental task in which Spanish-English CS production asymmetries that differ on their regional use and frequency were tested. Spanish-English code-switchers from this region of immersion demonstrate a robust preference for code-switches between the auxiliary verb *estar* and an English present participle (*estar* + V<sub>Prog</sub>) relative to switches between the light verb *hacer* and an English lexical infinitive (*hacer* + V<sub>Inf</sub>), despite the latterâ€™s syntactic plausibility and attestation in other Spanish-English bilingual communities. Code-switchers from the same region also suspend the use of masculine Spanish determiners (e.g., *el*) as predictive cues in determiner-noun switches; facilitative processing is only observed for English nouns with feminine Spanish translation equivalents preceded by feminine Spanish determiners (*la*<sub>FEM</sub> house<sub>FEM</sub>, Det<sub>SPA,FEM</sub> + N<sub>ENG,(FEM)</sub>), while English nouns with masculine Spanish translation
equivalents are categorically not produced with feminine Spanish determiners. **(Presented at FPM2024, [ISB14](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1V1p47XGXjBwZrtY17u45DcHOhLbxUOpd/view), [BHL2024](https://bhlmultilingualism.wixsite.com/bhl-multilingualism/copia-de-submissions), [HSP2024](https://hsp2024.github.io/abstracts/submission_291.pdf), and [BilForum2024](https://bilforum.hip.uic.edu/program/))**

# Experiment 2

To ensure that the time course for environmental frequency effects is distinct from that of ungrammaticality for L2 learners, a follow-up study (*n*=43) in which the syntactically plausible bilingual compound verb of the form *estar* + V<sub>Prog</sub> is tested against
the structurally disallowed switch *haber* + V<sub>Perf</sub>. If L2 learners show differential online sensitivity to grammatical violations and effects of environmental frequency, then the processing cost for the ungrammatical *haber* + V<sub>Perf</sub> form should emerge earlier than that for the syntactically plausible, but environmentally lacking, *hacer* + V<sub>Inf</sub> switch. **(Presented at [HSP2024](https://hsp2024.github.io/abstracts/submission_291.pdf) and [BilForum2024](https://bilforum.hip.uic.edu/program/))**
